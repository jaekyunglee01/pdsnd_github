### Project Title
BikeShare Analysis Project

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
